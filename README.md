# Sign Language Recognition System (CNN vs SVM)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning–based sign language recognition system. The goal was to compare the performance of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** using a custom-created dataset.

The project involved dataset creation, preprocessing, model training, hyper-parameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
